## EDA of Weekly Sales Data Across 45 Locations of a Major U.S. Department Store
By: Akash Wudali

### Overview:
This project explores the factors that affect weekly sales in various departments across 45 locations of a major U.S. department store. Key variables such as temperature, fuel prices, and price markdowns are analyzed to understand their impact on sales. By examining these relationships, I aim to provide insights into how the store can improve sales across its 45 locations.

In addition to this analysis, I built a regression model to predict the sales of Department 28 based on the temperature during a given week. I also used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the total sales over 50 weeks for the first location in the store chain (Store 1).

The notebook `EDA.ipynb` walks through the steps taken to clean, process, analyze, and model the data, providing actionable insights for both department store owners and potential investors.
